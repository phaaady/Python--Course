## Lists and Dictionaries

In order to create a dictionary in python, 


{Key : Value}
```

If we want more than one key and value, we use â€˜ , â€™ as shown below 


{"fadi" : "Best player", "Messi" : "Best PLayer" }


We can assign the entire dictionary to a variable as shown below 

programming = {"forloop" : "easy", "whileloop" : " tough ",}


In order to get a specific value from the dictionary , we give the key 

print(programming["fadi"])


Adding new items to dictionary later in the program

programming["cr7"] = "Second best player"


Itâ€™s usually best approach to start out with an empty dictionary, and then later add as we go on with our code in the later stages.

empty_dictionary = {}


To wipe an existing dictionary we can do the following 


programming = {}


This can be used if we want to clear out a userâ€™s progress, if a game starts over from beginning or anything like that.

To edit an item in a dictionary

programming["fadi"] = "worst player"


Looping through a dictionary :

for key in programming:
	print(key)
	print(programming[key])


### Student Grading Program

student_scores = {"Fadi" = 100 , "Ashiq" = 200 , "Shad" = 300}

#create an empty dictionary 
student_grades = {}

for student in student_scores:
	score = student_scores[student]
	if score>90:
			student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
	elif score>80:
			student_grades[student] = "Excellent"
	elif score>70:
			student_grades[student] = "Good"
	else:
			student_grades[student] = "Fail"

print(student_grades)
	


### Nesting Lists and Dictionaries

#nesting a list inside a dictionary
travel_log = {"India": ["Kerala", "Delhi", "Rajasthan"]}


- Each key can only have one value, you canâ€™t assign more than one value to a specific key.
- Hence, to give a number of values to a key, we can give a list. (as shown)

#nesting a dictionary within a dictionary
"France": {"visited":["paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]}


#nesting dictionary in a list
travel_log = [
			"country": "france", # the key "country" holds a string
		  "visited": ["paris", "lille", "Dijon"] # the key "visited" holds a list
]
```

## Interactive Coding Exercise

Weâ€™re going to create a function that add countries into a travel log.

def add_new_country (name, time_visited, cities_visited)
		new_country = {}
		new_country["country"] = name
		new_country["visits"] = times_visited
		new_country["cities"] = cities_visited
		#now to append/update to our already existing dictionary
		travel_log.append(new_country)
```

ðŸ’¡ append() is only used for adding to lists and not dictionaries.
